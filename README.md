# Picture-in-Picture-PiP-application
Picture-in-Picture (PiP) streaming is a common feature being implemented by YouTube, Facebook, etc., as you will encounter it everyday. This feature benefits us greatly from a large range of daily applications. For example, you are watching a coding tutorial but you want to code in full screen instead of splitting the screen into two. However, you don't want to buy an extra monitor. Therefore, a hovering PiP window can be used. With the flexibility of its position and size on your screen, you can now watch the tutorial video and code at the same time!
